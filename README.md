**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this product list project that includes a functional cart and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We provide the data for the products in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to populate the UI dynamically if you choose.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
